# Opal AI 💎

## 1\. Installation

### Getting Started

This guide will walk you through setting up the Opal AI project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

  * **[Bun](https://bun.sh/):** This project uses Bun for package management and as its runtime. It's a fast all-in-one JavaScript toolkit.
  * **[Git](https://git-scm.com/):** For cloning the repository.
  * **A Database Server:** The project is configured to use PostgreSQL, but you can adapt it to another database supported by Prisma (e.g., MySQL, SQLite).

### A. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/rizzit11/OpalAI.git](https://github.com/rizzit11/OpalAI.git)

Once the cloning is complete, navigate into the project directory:

Bash:
cd OpalAI

B. Project Setup
Follow these steps to install dependencies and configure the necessary environment variables.

Install Dependencies
Instead of npm or yarn, this project uses bun. Run the following command to install all the required packages listed in package.json:

Bash
bun install

Configure Environment Variables
The project requires several environment variables to connect to your database and external services (like Clerk, AWS, and AI APIs).
Create a new file in the root of the project directory named .env.local.
Copy the contents of the template below into your new .env.local file.
Replace the placeholder values (e.g., "your_database_url_here") with your actual credentials and API keys.

.env.local Template:
Code snippet

# Prisma Database URL
# Example for PostgreSQL: postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE
DATABASE_URL="your_database_url_here"

# Clerk Authentication (Get these from your Clerk Dashboard)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="your_clerk_publishable_key"
CLERK_SECRET_KEY="your_clerk_secret_key"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL="/sign-in"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL="/sign-up"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL="/dashboard"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL="/dashboard"

# AWS Credentials (For S3 and CloudFront)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_aws_access_key"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_aws_secret_key"
AWS_REGION="your_aws_region"
S3_BUCKET_NAME="your_s3_bucket_name"

# AI Service API Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
# Add other keys if needed for Whisper AI or VoiceFlow
VOICEFLOW_API_KEY="your_voiceflow_api_key"

# Application URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL="http://localhost:3000"
Set Up the Database
This project uses Prisma to manage the database schema. After configuring your DATABASE_URL in the .env.local file, run the following command to apply the schema to your database. This will create all the necessary tables.


Bash
bunx prisma migrate dev

You may be prompted to give the migration a name; you can enter something like init.

C. Running the Application
Once you have completed the setup, you can start the development server. Run the following command in your terminal:

Bash
bun run dev

This will start the Next.js application in development mode. You can now open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the application running.

2. About the Project
Opal AI is a powerful platform designed to make screen recordings intelligent and interactive. At its core, it's an ecosystem that transforms standard video content into a searchable and insightful knowledge base.

The project is split into two main components for the user:

The Web App (Next.js): This is your central dashboard. It's where you can manage your account, browse your library of recordings, and interact with the insights automatically generated by the AI.

The Desktop App (Electron.js): This is the tool you'll use for recording. We created a native desktop application so you can capture your entire screen—not just a single browser tab—ensuring a high-quality and complete recording of your workflow.

The process works by streaming your recording in real-time, piece by piece, to a dedicated Express.js server. This approach is robust and ensures that your data is saved continuously as you record. Once a recording is finished, this server kicks off an AI pipeline that automatically transcribes, summarizes, and analyzes your video, turning it into a fully interactive resource.

Key Features ✨
Native Screen Recording: High-fidelity screen and audio capture using the Electron.js desktop client.

Real-Time Streaming: Video is streamed and saved to the server as you record, minimizing data loss.

Secure Authentication: Robust user authentication powered by Clerk for both web and desktop.

AI-Powered Transcription: Automatic video-to-text transcription using Whisper AI.

Intelligent Content Generation: Automated video titles and summaries generated by OpenAI.

Interactive Knowledge Base: Transform video transcripts into a Q&A agent using VoiceFlow.

Scalable Cloud Infrastructure: Leverages AWS S3 for secure storage and AWS CloudFront for fast video streaming.

Dynamic User Experience: A sleek, modern frontend built with Next.js.

3. Architecture
The architecture of Opal AI is designed for robustness, scalability, and real-time performance. It separates concerns between the client applications, the real-time processing server, and the cloud infrastructure.

Architectural Breakdown:
The system operates through a series of coordinated workflows, which are visualized and explained below.

Stage 1: User Authentication
The user signs up or logs in through the Next.js or Electron application. Clerk handles the core authentication process. Upon success, a callback updates the user's profile in our database. The Electron app then syncs with this profile to get user-specific settings.

[ Web App / Desktop App ]
       |
       | 1. Login/Signup Request
       v
  [ Clerk Auth ]
       |
       | 2. Auth Webhook (user data)
       v
[ Next.js Backend API ]
       |
       | 3. Create/Update User
       v
[ (Database) ]
Stage 2: Real-Time Screen Recording & Ingestion
The user starts a recording in the Electron app. The app captures the screen and sends video "chunks" every second over a WebSocket to our dedicated Express.js server, which writes them to a temporary file.

[ Electron Desktop App ]
       |
       | 5. Stream Video Chunks (WebSocket)
       v
[ Express.js Server ]
       |
       | 6. Write chunks to a temporary file
       v
[ Temp File System ]
Stage 3: Video Processing, Storage & AI Enrichment
When the recording stops, the Express server tells the Next.js backend to create a "processing" entry in the database. The full video is then uploaded to a private AWS S3 bucket. Once the upload is complete, the AI pipeline kicks off: the video is transcribed by Whisper AI, summarized by OpenAI, and indexed by VoiceFlow. Finally, the database entry is updated to "completed" with all the new AI data, and the temporary file is deleted.

[ Express.js Server ]
       |
       | 7. API Call to Next.js -> [ Create "Processing" DB Entry ]
       |
       | 8. Upload complete video file
       v
[ AWS S3 Bucket ]
       |
       | 9. Upload is complete, start AI pipeline
       v
[ Express.js Server ]
       |
       |--> 10. Send to [ Whisper AI ] -> (Get Transcript)
       |
       |--> 11. Send Transcript to [ OpenAI ] -> (Get Title/Summary)
       |
       |--> 12. Send Transcript to [ VoiceFlow ] -> (Update Knowledge Base)
       |
       | 13. API Call to Next.js -> [ Update DB Entry to "Completed" with AI data ]
       |
       | 14. Delete temp file from [ Temp File System ]
       v
   (Process Complete)
Stage 4: Video Playback
When a user on the Next.js frontend clicks to watch a video, the request is routed through AWS CloudFront. To maintain security, CloudFront is the only service with permission to fetch the video from our private S3 bucket. It then securely streams the content with low latency to the user's browser.

[ Next.js Web App ]

       | 15. User requests to play a video
